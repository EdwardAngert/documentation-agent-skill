# Information Architecture Design Methodology

## Research Phase

### Develop User Personas

1. Identify distinct user groups
1. Card sorting exercises:
   - Open card sorting: Users group and label topics
   - Closed card sorting: Users fit topics into existing categories
   - Tools: Figma, Miro, OptimalSort
1. Document for each persona:
   - Role/background
   - Goals when using docs
   - Skill level
   - Primary tasks
   - Pain points

### Map User Journeys

- Entry points: How do users discover docs?
- Navigation patterns: Where do they look first?
- Common paths: Most frequent sequences
- Dead ends: Where do users get stuck?
- Success criteria: What does "found it" look like?

## Design Phase

### Structure Principles

- Match user mental models (not org chart)
- Progressive disclosure (overview → detail)
- Clear hierarchy (3-4 levels max)
- Consistent patterns (similar things in similar places)
- Logical grouping (related topics together)

### Design Navigation

- Global nav: Always accessible
- Local nav: Context-specific
- Search: Well-indexed, filtered
- Breadcrumbs: Show location in hierarchy
- Cross-references: Connect related topics

### Content Organization Patterns

- Task-based: Organized by user goals
- Topic-based: Organized by subject matter
- Reference: Alphabetical or categorized
- Hybrid: Combination based on content type

## Validation Phase

### Test Methods

- Tree testing: Can users find information?
- First-click testing: Do users start in the right place?
- User interviews: Does structure make sense?
- Analytics: Are users successful?

### Success Metrics

- Time to find information
- Search success rate
- Navigation depth
- Bounce rate on docs pages
- Support ticket reduction

## Implementation

### Plan Migration

- Create new structure
- Map old → new URLs (redirects)
- Update internal links
- Communicate changes
- Monitor for issues

### Maintain the Structure

- Regular content audits
- User feedback integration
- Analytics review
- Update personas as product evolves
