# Documentation Audit Framework

## Purpose

Systematic evaluation of existing documentation to identify gaps, inconsistencies, and improvement opportunities.

## Audit Phases

### Phase 1: Inventory

- List all existing documentation
- Categorize by type (tutorials, references, how-tos, explanations)
- Note last update dates
- Identify ownership/maintenance status

### Phase 2: Research Users

- Identify user personas
  - Method: Card sorting exercises (Figma/Miro)
  - Gather: User goals, pain points, skill levels
  - Document: Primary workflows for each persona

- Create user journeys
  - Map: How users discover and navigate docs
  - Identify: Points of friction
  - Document: Expected vs actual paths

### Phase 3: Analyze Content

- Evaluate each document:
  - Accuracy (is it current?)
  - Completeness (missing steps?)
  - Clarity (confusing explanations?)
  - Findability (can users locate it?)
  - Consistency (matches style guide?)

### Phase 4: Evaluate Information Architecture

- Evaluate current structure:
  - Does it match user mental models?
  - Are related topics grouped logically?
  - Is navigation intuitive?
  - Are hierarchy levels appropriate?

### Phase 5: Identify Gaps

- Missing documentation
- Outdated content
- Inconsistent terminology
- Navigation problems
- Style guide violations

### Phase 6: Prioritize Issues

Rank issues by:

- User impact (high/medium/low)
- Effort to fix (hours/days/weeks)
- Dependencies
- Business priority

## Deliverables

- Audit report with findings
- Prioritized improvement backlog
- User personas and journeys
- Proposed IA redesign
- Content templates
- Style guide recommendations
